has Demitri bivel it absolutely has Joseph Parker has joined us up here and and he's got to get away because it's quite cold it's quite cold Andy wants him to get away I I totally understand I've been addicted to your YouTube episodes that you've been dropping during the a camp it's been great inside the attention to detail in this second phase of your career as you described it around snc nutrition the boxing coaching but also the structure of camp and the family visiting everything you just seem like you've got it all down I feel like I feel like I do the work I've done with Andy and George and like everything coming together and I'm finding I found that balance in life and then boxing and in training and then Camp um and when you find that balance everything is uh like I'm a happy fighter which makes me a dangerous fighter and I've been happy all week because I'm calm and I'm relaxed and all the work's been done there's nothing more I could have done like I've done ticked all the boxes done everything right and now it's just time to put it all on display and and go out there and give it my best bigger stronger knockout win on Saturday for Joe Parker bigger faster stronger um better looking you look good best of luck to you Joe than best of luck thank you I well I rate that I rate that listen I think he has got better looking by the way Andy the beard he's got the beard game strong as well few more wrinkles than he used to have back in the day are are you with me on this Andy no 100% he's got that kind of leonida Spartan thing going on isn't he Gerald Butler you know what that's a big compliment isn't it he gone he didn't hear it that's that's a shame but um it's it's it's great watching these Elite athletes at work and getting that inside the Insight the fly on the wall stuff that that he's given us is great we don't get exactly the same kind of thing from Bol but I have seen some he's been training out in in turkey and you see some of the things he's been doing they're not Reinventing the wheel Demitri bivol and arto better be I know somebody like Joseph Parker one of the things that's always fascinated me about boxing is that okay snc is is developed nutrition has developed but Matt when it comes to the basics of it the kit that you find in the gym now is the kit that you found in the gym a 100 years ago the basics of boxing are the same and they always will be the same and as I said these two at the top of the bill they know that it's about drilling it's about repetition some people find that boring other people love it no look snc is great in the sense that it makes you fitter faster stronger but in terms of tactics and technique and things that work in boxing are the same things that always worked in boxing like as you say you can't reinvent the wheel I'll tell you what Demitri bivel looks very very calm and relaxed gave us a little something there showed us that so sty let's hear from him Demetri it's been a long time since you were introduced as a title Challenger how are you feeling going into this fight it's something uh New Again Challenger it's new fresh feelings uh I like it you went 12 hard rounds with archer BBV a few months ago what did you learn from that experience I learned that I don't like to lose and I want to win you've said this week that the biggest adjustment you have to make is to throw more punches does that mean you'll be taking more chances in the ring yeah of course uh not only more punches more movements more better speed better uh more heavier punches felt his power for 12 rounds does that make you more prepared for it the next time around uh it's not about to prepare against the power it's more about to make yourself better and to be ready for all situations in the ring do you think this fight will look a lot like the first fight or are you expecting a very different one I'm so excited like all of boxing fans how it will be this is why it's so interesting I think good luck to MRI thank you I'll tell you what it sounds like Dmitri bivel shares our excitement about Saturday night he's excited on behalf of boxing fans and that's just great to hear because this is the elite end of the but and you want these guys to have that kind of attitude to it and they both do and now let's welcome the defending Champion he is a two-time Olympian now undefeated as a professional with 21 wins 20 of his 21 wins coming by way of knockout he is the hard-hitting Ring magazine champion and the reing and defending Undisputed Li heavyweight champion of the world Arthur b b well here comes the enigmatic heavy-handed chesen monster the Undisputed World light heavyweight champion arur Bev hasn't given much away this week in terms of his answers sometimes they're one word sometimes they're two his two favorite ones are will see I can't imagine Chris manx will get an awful lot out of him in the interview but where we do get so much out of him is when that first bell rings and it is non-stop pressure yeah constantly exerting pressure on his opponents because he carries that power as well the nervous energy the tension the concentration Factor you know and I was so impressed with how bival actually coped with that you know but uh he did come on strong at the end and i' imagine in this fight he may even try that fin fin push a little bit earlier it was rounds 10 11 and 12 in the first fight that he was really in the ascendancy and it just felt like bivel was flagging a little bit and maybe those Championship rounds won him the fight last time I think they did I think that's exactly what happened he came on really really strong towards the end and he needed to he needed to his Corner were telling him that he needed to and at the end of the fight they they were unsure as we all were which way it was going to go they they maybe felt that he started to get to him or picked it up a little bit too late but it's a really interesting measuring stick that for him pacing that 12 rounds because he's massively experienced but he never done it and when you always stop someone and the pressure has always got to them in the end when you find yourself in there with somebody who is able to handle it better than anybody else has how do you know when to really put your foot down it's hard isn't it very hard and you and you got get it right because you don't want to go too soon and then run out you have a final have a good final push but not get him and then you've ran out of gas and all of a sudden then B you know Nick it off you again well he is now 40 years old but a tremendously fit man completely lives the life and this is the quickest turnaround of fights that he has had in 10 years only 4 months separate better be of bivel one and better Bev bivel to will that be an advantage for better Bev will it be a disadvantage what what do you think Andy I think it's going to suit the pair of them absolutely fine to be honest I don't think that better Bev is still going to be feeling that first fight it was really intense it wasn't an absolute War but very very intense concentration levels had to be incredibly high in terms of the physical nature of it they both got themselves into incredible shape by the end of the 12 rounds they were pretty spent but I think they'll have had a good amount of time to rest recuperate and come again and the uh oh wow be hop The Executioner Bernard Hopkins is just sidling in next to us which is uh which is absolutely tremendous well yes we are watching a bit of a a modern Legend in better have in the ring delighted to have Bernard Hopkins a real boxing Legend in our company how are you Berard I'm fine I'm fine how are everybody everybody sound good look good you excited man it's just Saturday's Blockbuster tell me about this Main Event you've had a lot of joy in this white division this is a special fight look this is a fight where Ral wants to prove that he's still relevant and he's still the best at 175 look the liwe division has always been a step to the cruiserweight than some heavyweight but this division vision is so I guess challenging to anybody fighting at 175 because you have a a a really a exciting division that hasn't been like that since a long time Holyfield I can go back to Holyfield I'm a philia guy I I can go back to Matthew S Muhammad um Marvin Johnson the LI haward division has always been a sort of like a the best kept secret division with guys that either went to heavyweight or Cruiserweight but we were just talking about better beev and how he's achieved longevity into his 40s nobody knows better than you how how you go about doing that well he has to be himself and use all the skills that he have I mean both guys are are are really good season know what they want to do is who do it the best this this this is the type of fight where both guys are good at what they do whoever made the less mistakes will win let's hear from arur betv well Arthur here we are again you and Demitri Beville the Undisputed light heavyweight championship just a few days away how are you feeling going into this fight I'm not a bad does it feel any different having experienced 12 rounds with bille the first time you you not have that experience to lean on yeah it's different yeah a little bit different but it's good it's good experience you know after that first fight both you and your trainer Mark Ramsey said you can do a lot better the next time around what can you do better everything everything I will try to do everything better are you expecting a different version of Demitri bevil maybe maybe we'll see you got off to a little bit of a slow start in that fight you've gotten off to slow starts at different times during your career is it important to you in this fight to get off to a faster start you know we'll see like never know how it's going",

As the boxing world gears up for the highly anticipated rematch between Dmitry Bivol and Artur Beterbiev, excitement is palpable. This showdown promises to be a thrilling encounter, not just for the fighters but for fans who have been eagerly awaiting this clash of titans. In a recent YouTube video featuring insights from boxing experts and the fighters themselves, several key themes emerged that highlight the significance of this bout and the preparations leading up to it.

### The Fighters: A Study in Contrasts

Dmitry Bivol, the challenger, has not held this title in a while, and his return to this role brings a fresh perspective. He expressed a sense of excitement about being a challenger again, indicating that this new phase in his career has reinvigorated his approach to the sport. Bivol's training camp has been meticulously structured, focusing on strength and conditioning (S&C), nutrition, and the mental aspects of boxing. He emphasized the importance of balance in his life, stating, "When you find that balance, everything is... I'm a happy fighter, which makes me a dangerous fighter." This sentiment resonates deeply in the boxing community, where mental fortitude is as crucial as physical prowess.

On the other hand, Artur Beterbiev, the defending champion, is known for his relentless pressure and knockout power. With an impressive record of 21 wins, 20 by knockout, Beterbiev's reputation as a hard-hitting champion precedes him. His enigmatic personality adds an intriguing layer to his fighting style, often leaving fans and analysts guessing about his strategy. Beterbiev's calm demeanor and focus on executing his game plan make him a formidable opponent, and his experience from their first encounter will undoubtedly play a role in his approach this time around.

### Key Insights from the Fighters

Both fighters shared valuable insights during the video, shedding light on their preparations and expectations for the rematch. Bivol acknowledged the need to throw more punches and increase his movement in the ring, suggesting a willingness to take calculated risks. This adjustment could be pivotal, as he aims to capitalize on the lessons learned from their previous bout, where he felt the pressure of Beterbiev's power.

Beterbiev, in contrast, expressed confidence in his ability to improve upon his previous performance. He stated, "Everything I will try to do everything better," indicating a commitment to refining his technique and strategy. The anticipation surrounding whether he can start faster in this fight adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, as both fighters seek to assert their dominance early on.

### The Importance of Experience

Experience plays a crucial role in boxing, and both fighters bring a wealth of it to the ring. Bivol's previous encounter with Beterbiev provided him with invaluable insights into his opponent's style and capabilities. He learned not only about Beterbiev's power but also about the mental and physical demands of a championship fight. This experience will likely inform his strategy, as he aims to adapt and improve upon his previous performance.

Beterbiev, now 40 years old, has demonstrated remarkable longevity in the sport. His ability to maintain peak physical condition and adapt his training regimen is a testament to his dedication. The video highlighted the importance of pacing oneself throughout the fight, especially in the championship rounds, where experience can make all the difference. Beterbiev's previous fight against Bivol showcased his ability to push through fatigue and maintain pressure, a skill that could prove decisive in their rematch.

### The Role of Strategy and Tactics

As the fighters prepare for this high-stakes encounter, the discussion around strategy and tactics becomes increasingly relevant. Boxing experts emphasized that while advancements in strength and conditioning have transformed training methods, the fundamental techniques of boxing remain unchanged. The basics—footwork, head movement, and effective punching—are timeless elements that both fighters must master to succeed.

Bivol's focus on increasing his punch output and movement suggests a strategic shift aimed at outmaneuvering Beterbiev's power. Conversely, Beterbiev's approach will likely involve maintaining pressure and capitalizing on any openings that arise. The interplay of these strategies will be fascinating to watch, as both fighters seek to impose their will on the other.

### Conclusion: A Fight for the Ages

As fight night approaches, the anticipation surrounding the Bivol vs. Beterbiev rematch continues to build. Both fighters have demonstrated a commitment to improvement and a deep understanding of the stakes involved. With Bivol's newfound balance and Beterbiev's relentless pressure, fans can expect a thrilling contest that showcases the best of what boxing has to offer.
